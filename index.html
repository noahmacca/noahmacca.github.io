			<p>I value curiosity and growth, and dream of a future where technology will free us of death, suffering, bias, and other limitations.</p>
			<p>Professionally, I’ve built expertise in a wide variety of disciplines. <b>Product</b> is my strongest skillset: at <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-apple-store-of-doctors-offices">Forward</a> I dramatically improved company-level growth, economics, and medical quality metrics, and at <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/features/meet-loop-the-team-at-microsoft-behind-arrow-changing-the-way-they-work-to-make-a-big-impact/">Microsoft</a> I’ve launched exciting new products on an incubation team. I’ve gone deep on <b>software engineering</b> at Forward, building new systems to increase efficiency of care delivery, and creating new experiences with medical devices and data, and <b>ML and Data Science</b> at Microsoft, being a key resource for all analysis and ML needs. I’ve also done <b>academic research</b> at Harvard and MIT, working on various medical device projects, stem cells, and pharmaceuticals. I was fortunate enough to <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=M1M8fWIAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao">co-author five papers</a>, with a combined 500+ citations.</p>
			<p>When I'm not working, I'm probably cycling, reading, journaling, hanging out in my community house, or backpacking in the mountains.</p>
			<p>I care deeply about applying technology to healthcare and education to simultaneously improve quality, improve access, and decrease cost. I'm exploring new ideas, please reach out if you'd like to chat.</p>
