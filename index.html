			<p>Iâ€™m a techno-optimist whoâ€™s in love with life and wants to help build a better world through better connection and better technology. I value curiosity, optimism, passion, and growth.</p>
			<p>As a result of aggressively going deep in many areas, I consider myself a product-focused generalist. I think itâ€™s a superpower to be able to refine and implement ideas at the speed of synapses rather than a large team.</p>
			<p>Most recently, I started <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/eureka-health-pitch-deck-raise-7-million-seed-khosla-ventures-2023-8">Eureka Health</a> to fix clinical trials by making them much cheaper, faster, and a better experience for patients. We raised millions and impacted tens of thousands of patients. I was an early engineer and product manager at <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-apple-store-of-doctors-offices">Forward</a>, where I helped build the Bodyscanner from scratch, establish our first clinic, and improve our growth and clinical excellence. I was a data scientist at <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/features/meet-loop-the-team-at-microsoft-behind-arrow-changing-the-way-they-work-to-make-a-big-impact/">Microsoft</a> working on special projects in the AI & Research division, acting as the bridge between ML research and the new products we were shipping. Before that I was doing research at <a href="https://wyss.harvard.edu/news/novel-non-stick-material-joins-portfolio-of-slippery-surface-technologies/">Harvard and MIT</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=M1M8fWIAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao">published 5 papers</a> on biomaterials and drug development, with a total of 600+ citations.</p>
			<p>When I'm not working, I'm probably cycling, running, reading, hanging out in my community house, playing the piano, or backpacking in the mountains.</p>
